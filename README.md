Welcome to the Aesir github repo. The objective here is to make our own take on an online RPG client.

Made in Golang.

Everything is empty since we're just starting, but the idea is to create a microservices system that allows easy extensibility
of games and resources while offering the usual basic services.

If this all sounds confusing (blame twosevenska) think of this as an online service that allows you to, for example, play a Pathfinder RPG session over the internet with your custom adventure/monsters/items.
